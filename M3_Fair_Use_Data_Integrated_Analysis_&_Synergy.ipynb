        "In Milestone 2, our team’s preprocessing work showed that using both `fair_use_cases` and `fair_use_findings` together adds complexity without improving analytical coverage. Although the documentation suggests the two tables represent the same set of cases, in practice they behave like two partially redundant views with inconsistent identifiers. As a result, Milestone 2 workflows increasingly treated a single table as the source of truth for modeling, and Milestone 3 continues that approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "After inspecting both tables, they appear to contain the same number of rows and to be intended as two views of the same set of cases. The fields are partitioned differently across the two tables, but much of the metadata overlaps. For this notebook, `fair_use_findings` is used as the primary analysis table because it contains the richest information for unstructured methods, especially the detailed text fields that drive our topic modeling, similarity, case typing, and outlier detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key overlap and differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Identifiers:** `fair_use_findings` provides `title` and `case_number`, which together serve the same purpose as the single `case` identifier column in `fair_use_cases`. These columns are primarily for reference and reporting rather than modeling.\n",
        "* **Year:** the `year` field is present in both tables.\n",
        "* **Court information:** `fair_use_cases` includes `court` and `jurisdiction`, while `fair_use_findings` includes `court`. These fields provide overlapping venue information, and a single court or venue field is sufficient for the planned analysis.\n",
        "* **Labels and outcomes:** both tables include an `outcome` column describing the fair use result at a high level.\n",
        "* **Text fields (unique to `fair_use_findings`):** `key_facts`, `issue`, and `holding` provide narrative summaries that directly support text-based unsupervised analysis. These columns were central across Milestone 2 notebooks and are the main reason `fair_use_findings` is preferred.\n",
        "* **Outcome labeling:** `fair_use_findings` does not include a boolean `fair_use_found`, so an outcome label is derived from the `outcome` text. Outcomes are standardized and mapped into three groups: **fair use found**, **fair use not found**, and **indeterminate** (preliminary, mixed, remand, or unclear).\n",
        "\n",
        "During Milestone 2 preprocessing, we tested whether the tables could be reliably joined so we could carry both sets of columns forward. A direct join was attempted by reconstructing the `case` identifier from `title` and `case_number`, but the match rate was extremely low because identifiers are not standardized across files (citation formatting, punctuation, abbreviations, and capitalization vary across sources). In our validation check, a direct join matched only **30 of 251 records (12.0%)** when verifying that text fields were correctly transferred.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improving this join would require record linkage methods such as fuzzy matching or embedding similarity, followed by manual verification to prevent false matches. Since the tables are largely redundant for shared metadata and `fair_use_findings` already contains the critical unstructured fields used throughout Milestone 2, Milestone 3 uses `fair_use_findings` alone as the working analysis table. This keeps the pipeline reproducible, avoids silent merge errors, and ensures every downstream method operates on a consistent, clean master dataset."
