        "In Milestone 2, we explicitly tested whether `fair_use_cases` and `fair_use_findings` could be integrated into a single “master” dataset. A straightforward join attempt exposed a structural mismatch, producing only a **12% match rate**. Follow-up preprocessing improved linkage substantially by normalizing formatting differences (for example, standardizing “vs” to “v” and stripping punctuation), recovering **70.5% of records (177 cases)** in one improved approach. Other join strategies achieved results in the **low 30% range**, but still left a large portion unmatched. Even when match rates increase, the remaining unmatched share is large enough that (1) we risk losing too many cases if we require a strict join, and (2) we risk introducing false matches if we loosen the rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Milestone 3, we prioritize a reproducible pipeline with minimal merge risk. As an integration choice, we therefore use **`fair_use_findings` as the single working analysis table** and treat `fair_use_cases` as optional metadata rather than a required dependency. This aligns with the core modeling needs of the milestone, since the unstructured methods depend most heavily on the narrative fields in `fair_use_findings`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key overlap and differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Identifiers:** `fair_use_findings` includes `title` and `case_number`, which together serve the same reference role as the single `case` string in `fair_use_cases`. These fields are mainly used for labeling and lookup rather than as modeling features.\n",
        "* **Year:** `year` is present in both tables and can be used directly without merging.\n",
        "* **Court and venue information:** `fair_use_cases` includes `court` and `jurisdiction`, while `fair_use_findings` includes `court`. These are overlapping venue signals, and a single court field is sufficient for the planned clustering and venue-aware comparisons.\n",
        "* **Outcomes:** both tables include an `outcome` field describing the fair use result at a high level, which supports standardized labeling.\n",
        "* **Text fields unique to `fair_use_findings`:** `key_facts`, `issue`, and `holding` contain the narrative summaries required for text based unsupervised methods. In Milestone 2, the primary modeling text was often constructed from **`key_facts + issue`** to reduce decision language leakage from holdings, and this combined text averaged **about 145 words**, which is well suited to TF IDF, topic modeling, and clustering workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outcome labeling:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Because `fair_use_findings` does not provide a boolean `fair_use_found`, we derive labels from `outcome` text and standardize into three groups: **fair use found**, **fair use not found**, and **indeterminate**.\n",
        "* For venue comparisons, we compute outcome related metrics using **determinate outcomes only** to avoid mixing final decisions with preliminary, mixed, or remand-like resolutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the documentation suggests the two tables are aligned, Milestone 2 preprocessing showed that joining them reliably requires record linkage methods plus validation. Since `fair_use_findings` already contains the critical unstructured fields used across the milestone’s modeling tracks, we proceed using **one table** based on `fair_use_findings` to maximize coverage, avoid merge induced data loss, and reduce the risk of incorrect joins."

SBCCI encouraged local governments, free of charge, to enact its copyright protected codes into law by reference in statutes and ordinances. Generally, the public was advised they could obtain access and make copies of portions of the codes in city offices or local libraries. Plaintiff Peter Veeck operated a website providing information about North Texas, including full texts of local building codes. When Veeck failed to obtain copies of the building codes in his hometown, he purchased a copy of the codes in electronic format from SBCCI and posted it on his website. After SBCCI sent him a cease and desist order accusing him of copyright infringement, Veeck filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that he did not infringe SBCCI\\u2019s copyright. Veeck appealed the district court\\u2019s ruling finding that publication of the codes was not a fair use.\",\n          \"Plaintiff Elliot McGucken, a fine art photographer, posted several photographs he took of an ephemeral lake in Death Valley to his public Instagram account. Defendant, Newsweek LLC, contacted McGucken to request permission to upload one of these photographs (the \\u201cPhotograph\\u201d) to its website, but McGucken did not respond. Newsweek subsequently embedded McGucken\\u2019s Instagram post of the Photograph in an online article about the ephemeral lake, titled \\u201cHuge Lake Appears in Death Valley, One of the Hottest, Driest Places on Earth.\\u201d McGucken brought an action for copyright infringement, alleging Newsweek reproduced and displayed the Photograph online without permission. After the court denied Newsweek\\u2019s motion to dismiss McGucken\\u2019s direct copyright infringement claim, both parties moved for summary judgment, and Newsweek again asserted that its use of the Photograph constituted a fair use.\",\n          \"Plaintiff Joe Baraban owned the copyright in a photograph of a dairy farmer posing with a cow in a field of yellow clover. The U.S. Council for Energy Awareness (USCEA) used the photograph with the author\\u2019s permission in an advertisement supporting nuclear energy that ran in several national newspapers and magazines. Defendant Time Warner, Inc. published defendant Gerald Celente\\u2019s book, Trends 2000: How to Prepare for and Profit from the Changes of the 21st Century (Trends). The book included the advertisement along with commentary criticizing the nuclear energy industry. Defendants only slightly altered the advertisement by making it black and white, shrinking it to fit the page layout, and cropping it to exclude USCEA\\u2019s information. Defendants alleged that they were unable to get permission because USCEA apparently had ceased to exist, and they could not locate plaintiff.

The court first determined that model codes, while similar to uncopyrightable statutes and judicial opinions, do not lose their copyright when used or adopted by a state or local government. The court then found that Veeck\\u2019s use, while noncommercial per se, could severely undermine the market for SBCCI\\u2019s works if such use became widespread. The court found that Veeck\\u2019s copying and posting of SBCCI\\u2019s codes would reduce SBCCI\\u2019s market and deprive it of income used in its socially valuable effort of creating and promulgating these codes. Note: upon rehearing, the appeals court reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss SBCCI\\u2019s claims based on the reasoning that Veeck copied only the law and did not infringe SBCCI\\u2019s copyrights in building codes. A dissent by four judges including the chief judge found that SBCCI\\u2019s posting of the entire building code on the website was not fair use. Veeck v. S. Bldg. Code Cong. Int\\u2019l, Inc., 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002)\",\n          \"For all four factors, the court concluded that a jury must resolve genuine issues of material fact before weighing and balancing the factors. The court concluded that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, did not clearly favor either party. In the court\\u2019s view, a reasonable jury could find either that Newsweek\\u2019s use was transformative because the Photograph was used to report a newsworthy event and Newsweek added commentary or that the use was not transformative because it was a verbatim copy published with generic text. Because of unresolved factual disputes, the court could not determine on summary judgment the commerciality of the use and whether Newsweek acted in bad faith. The court explained that the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, was also unsuitable for summary judgment because, although the Photograph is creative, a jury could find that Newsweek\\u2019s use was transformative and did not interfere with McGucken\\u2019s ability to control the first public appearance of the work. The court found that the weight of the third factor, the amount and substantiality of the use, would also need to be determined by a jury relative to its assessment of the \\u201ctransformative and distinctive purpose\\u201d of the use. Nonetheless, the court noted that \\u201cit is difficult . . . to see how [Newsweek] could have used less than the entirety of the Photograph.\\u201d The court concluded that the fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, required a jury to resolve factual issues concerning the extent to which Newsweek\\u2019s embedding affected the media licensing and fine art markets for the Photograph. Ultimately, the court declined to determine fair use as a matter of law, and denied both parties\\u2019 summary judgment motions.\",\n          \"The court held that defendants\\u2019 use of the advertisement in Trends qualified as fair use. The court concluded that defendants\\u2019 use was clearly for purposes of criticism and comment as the book\\u2019s author used the photo to show the nature of the nuclear energy industry\\u2019s advertisements and provided additional commentary concerning those advertisements. The court rejected plaintiff\\u2019s argument that the use was satirical, not for parody. According to the court, Trends criticized the photo, at least in part, because it highlighted a particular view \\u2014the \\u201csunny\\u201d view of nuclear power\\u2014 that the industry intended to promote. The court found the second factor was neutral because while the purposeful setting, angles, and other artistic elements made the photo highly creative and weighed in plaintiff\\u2019s favor, the context of its use was as part of an advertisement, and this weighed in favor of the defendants. For the third factor, the court held that defendants\\u2019 slight modifications were enough to give the reader the sense of the campaign without completely copying the work exactly. Finally, the court held that the market value of the photograph was not harmed by the publication in Trends, since it was unlikely that a black-and-white, comparatively miniscule version would negatively affect a market, the existence of which was already \\u201cdubious.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tags\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sixth Circuit; Textual work\",\n          \"Computer Program\",\n          \"Third Circuit; Textual work; Unpublished\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"outcome\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAIR_USE_NOT_FOUND\",\n          \"INDETERMINATE\",\n          \"FAIR_USE_FOUND\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
